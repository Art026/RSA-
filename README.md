# RSA
Rivest-Shamir-Adleman algorithm is used to encrypt and decrypt messages.

The code is provided for the implementation of this algorithm using GUI.

We provide them with a public key which must be entered while giving in the plain text to the GUI.

This plain text provided is ecrypted into Ciphertext and sent by the sender.

To decrypt the message, the receiver must enter the private key, which on being the correct one decrypts the ciphertext back to the plaintext and the message is received successfully.
